# Classification-of-Hand-written-digits-using-Neural-networks

• Implemented Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network to recognize hand
written digits using feed forward and back propagation techniques.
• Trained neural network with 50000 images and validated & tested with
10000 images.
• Evaluation was done based on metrics like error rate and accuracy.
Achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test data and validation data.

Note:

• Project description is available in the file assignment.pdf
• Code is available in code/nnScript.py and the learned weights is saved in
code/params.pickle file.
• The report is available in report/proj1_group57.pdf file.
